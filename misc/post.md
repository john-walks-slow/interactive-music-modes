## Visualization of modes and scales

![alt](screenshot.png)

I built this website for fun. You can easily switch between modes and see how intervals change between them. Since there is a shortcut for everything (scales, modes, notes, even chords), you can even experiment with modal mixture with your computer keyboard.

I hope some of you will find it interesting.

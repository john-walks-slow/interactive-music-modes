This is a web-based application for exploring and understanding modes and scales. It provides an interactive and visual way to see how each mode is constructed, hear how it sounds, and learn the chords associated with each scale degree.

Every mode, tonic, note, and chord can also be accessed with keyboard shortcut. You can easily experiment with modal mixture & borrowed chords using your computer keyboard.
